class PrivacyEngine:
    r"""
    The main component of Opacus is the ``PrivacyEngine``.

    To train a model with differential privacy, all you need to do
    is to define a ``PrivacyEngine`` and later attach it to your
    optimizer before running.


    Example:
        This example shows how to define a ``PrivacyEngine`` and to attach
        it to your optimizer.

        >>> import torch
        >>> model = torch.nn.Linear(16, 32)  # An example model
        >>> optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.05)
        >>> privacy_engine = PrivacyEngine(model, batch_size, sample_size, alphas=range(2,32), noise_multiplier=1.3, max_grad_norm=1.0)
        >>> privacy_engine.attach(optimizer)  # That's it! Now it's business as usual.

        Takes a virtual step.

        Virtual batches enable training with arbitrary large batch sizes, while
        keeping the memory consumption constant. This is beneficial, when training
        models with larger batch sizes than standard models.

        Example:
            Imagine you want to train a model with batch size of 2048, but you can only
            fit batch size of 128 in your GPU. Then, you can do the following:

            >>> for i, (X, y) in enumerate(dataloader):
            >>>     logits = model(X)
            >>>     loss = criterion(logits, y)
            >>>     loss.backward()
            >>>     if i % 16 == 15:
            >>>         optimizer.step()    # this will call privacy engine's step()
            >>>         optimizer.zero_grad()
            >>>     else:
            >>>         optimizer.virtual_step()   # this will call privacy engine's virtual_step()

            The rough idea of virtual step is as follows:

            1. Calling ``loss.backward()`` repeatedly stores the per-sample gradients
            for all mini-batches. If we call ``loss.backward()`` ``N`` times on
            mini-batches of size ``B``, then each weight's ``.grad_sample`` field will
            contain ``NxB`` gradients. Then, when calling ``step()``, the privacy engine
            clips all ``NxB`` gradients and computes the average gradient for an effective
            batch of size ``NxB``. A call to ``optimizer.zero_grad()`` erases the
            per-sample gradients.

            2. By calling ``virtual_step()`` after ``loss.backward()``,the ``B``
            per-sample gradients for this mini-batch are clipped and summed up into a
            gradient accumulator. The per-sample gradients can then be discarded. After
            ``N`` iterations (alternating calls to ``loss.backward()`` and
            ``virtual_step()``), a call to ``step()`` will compute the average gradient
            for an effective batch of size ``NxB``.

            The advantage here is that this is memory-efficient: it discards the per-sample
            gradients after every mini-batch. We can thus handle batches of arbitrary size.
